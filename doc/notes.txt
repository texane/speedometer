fsampl
5hz max
512 bytes block, 8 bytes per sampl = 64 sampl per block
blocks written every 13s
2h session = 7200 blocks = 3.6MB

procedure:
. at startup, read first block
. generate a magic from the 8 first bytes
. this magic is prepended to all blocks so that we know if
the block belongs to this session

OR
. at boot, read and look for an unused block
. start at this first unused block
. the external software will be in charge of erasing the session

OR
. use minimal version of FAT
. one file per session with max size to avoid 

TODO
. in meta data, log coordinates
. in meta data, log max speed
. configure GPS in 115200 bauds
. configure GPS to send only $GPGVT and coordinates
